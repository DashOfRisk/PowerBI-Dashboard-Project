# 🌐 Website in Power BI (WIP)

🚀 This project, inspired by the Power BI Park community, showcases how to create a website-like interface inside Power BI. The goal is to leverage the power of SVGs for incredible customisation, making it possible to embed images, create dynamic visuals, and transform data into visually engaging reports. 🌟

🔧 Expect features like adjusting SVG dimensions and styles, custom backgrounds, adding text, icons, status indicators, integrating filters and search bars, applying conditional formatting, interactive navigation, and tooltip customisation. With these enhancements, you'll create professional job cards and interactive dashboards that blend data with stunning visuals.  🌐👨‍💻
