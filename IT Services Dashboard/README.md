# Power BI PoC: IT Service Desk Metrics

## Project Overview

This Proof of Concept (PoC) report in Power BI showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) for IT service operations over the last 3 years. The project aims to improve the efficiency of service desk interactions and provide insights into customer support across multiple communication channels:  
- **Calls**  
- **Emails**  
- **Chats**  
- **Escalations**

## Key Features of the Report

### 1. Data Analysis for Service Desk Interactions
The dataset tracks interaction volumes, resolution times, and categorises the data by interaction type.  
**Key Metrics Tracked:**  
- Volume of interactions  
- Resolution time per issue  
- Category-specific breakdowns (e.g., Account-related issues, Payment-related queries, Account opening/closing questions)

### 2. Top 5 & Bottom 5 Categories
The report identifies the top 5 categories with the highest interaction volume and the bottom 5 categories, allowing users to filter by specific issue types using **Power BI slicers**.

### 3. AI-Powered Dataset Generation
Leveraged **AI Tools** to generate a mock dataset with pervasive issues for rapid prototyping, allowing for quick testing of different reporting scenarios without relying on a live limited dataset.

### 4. DAX Measures for Advanced Insights
Created custom **DAX measures** to calculate important metrics such as average resolution times, SLA compliance, and performance breakdowns by issue category.

### 5. Visualisations and Formatting
Built responsive, interactive dashboards using **Power BI** features, including conditional formatting to highlight trends and KPIs. Interactive filters and slicers allow users to drill down by interaction type or issue category for a more detailed analysis.

## Skills Applied & Developed

### Power BI Data Modelling
- Worked with time-based data and structured date tables for optimal reporting performance along with **External Tools** such as SQLBI.  
- Created dynamic, user-friendly dashboards that present actionable insights.

### DAX & Data Analysis
- Applied advanced **DAX** functions to calculate resolution time, SLA performance, and other KPIs.  
- Simplified complex data using slicers and filters to make insights more accessible.

### AI Integration (ChatGPT for Dataset Creation)
- Leveraged **ChatGPT** to generate realistic datasets, enabling rapid prototyping and testing without a fully developed live dataset.

## Impact & Next Steps

This PoC report provides valuable insights into IT service desk performance, offering opportunities for data-driven decision-making and service optimisation. Moving forward, I aim to:  
- Apply **Power BI** reporting for advanced Power Query data cleaning techniques and star schema for enhanced BI systems.  
- Continue building advanced dashboards to monitor and improve service desk efficiency.  
- Experiment with AI tools to further enhance and automate reporting capabilities.
